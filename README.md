World-War
=========

Plugin for the popular server modding API, Bukkit. The goal is to create a world wide (Nether AND End included) capture the flag game with different classes and vehicles

### Getting Started

World War currently requires a few libraries to get running. 

* [MoreProjectiles](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/lib-1-7-moreprojectiles.171927/)
* [DisguiseCraft](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/disguisecraft/)
* [Bukkit 1.7.5-R0.1-20140402/231158-6](http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ok9llar7nvja9uy/bukkit-1.7.5-R0.1-20140402.231158-6.jar)

*This Bukkit API build is hosted by me to continue Bukkit version compatibility*
* Built using JDK 1.7
* Using Eclipse for IDE, but any IDE is fine

### Recommended Coding Practices

Some of my own Java Practices are RECOMMENDED to be used in this plugin. However, this does not mean your Pull Request/Contribution will be denied if you don't follow them, it is only suggested.

* Deprecate a method/class before deleting it
* Use comments to disable code that will be needed later
* When using a "try" statement, print what the plugin was doing when the error occured, not just the stacktrace
