World-War
=========
** Currently undergoing a complete rewrite for Spigot and Minecraft 1.8.8 **

Plugin for the popular server modding API, Bukkit. The goal is to create a world wide (Nether AND End included) capture the flag game with different classes and vehicles

### Getting Started

World War currently requires a few libraries to get running. 

* Spigot 1.8.8, use Spigot's BuildTools to get the required jar (spigot-1.8.8.jar)

* Built using JDK 1.7
* Using Eclipse for IDE, but any IDE is fine

### Recommended Coding Practices

Some of my own Java Practices are RECOMMENDED to be used in this plugin. However, this does not mean your Pull Request/Contribution will be denied if you don't follow them, it is only suggested.

* Deprecate a method/class before deleting it
* Use comments to disable code that will be needed later
* When using a "try" statement, print what the plugin was doing when the error occured, not just the stacktrace
